# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Aspect-oriented model (AOM) composition techniques are responsible  for  expressing  crosscutting relationships between aspect and base models. However, given their growing heterogeneity, it  is particularly hallenging for designers to both objectively assess them and take decision on which is the best  according to their supported composition facilities. This  work provides a systematic comparison of representative AOM composition techniques. For this purpose, we propose a set of proposed evaluation criteria: the model composition process followed; the  manner  of  matching the input  models; the type of  composition  strategies used; the manner of assessing the composition  results; and how  the techniques address conflict resolution. Such criteria enable us to pinpoint the commonalities and differences as well as strengths and shortcomings of the three studied techniques."
