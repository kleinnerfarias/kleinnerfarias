# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The integration of variability models (e.g., feature models) is considered an error-prone activity, which can consume a lot of effort from development teams working in parallel, thereby compromising developers’ productivity as well as the quality of software developed. For this, many ntegration techniques have been proposed in last decades to support developers to integrate feature models. However, there is a lack of a generic architecture that helps developers to produce integration tools in the current literature. To overcome this shortcoming, this work proposes a flexible, component-based architecture for supporting the integration of feature models. In addition, a model integration workflow for helping developers to improve the understanding of the crucial composition activities and their relationships is also presented."
