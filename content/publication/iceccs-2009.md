# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In this paper we explore the use of formal ontology in model comparison. Most techniques used in the MDA community are essentially syntactic, and rely on typographical hints, such as attribute data types and labels to determine similarity. We have adapted and incorporated an ontology alignment technique, as the means to obtain more precise and reliable similarity measurements between model elements, a fundamental issue in model comparison and composition."
