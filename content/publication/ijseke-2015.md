# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Context: Model comparison plays a central role in many software engineering activities. However, a comprehensive understanding about the state-of-the-art is still required. Goal: This paper aims at classifying and performing a thematic analysis of the current literature. Method: For this, we have followed well-established empirical guidelines to de¯ne and perform a systematic mapping study. Results: Some studies (14 out of 40) provide generic model comparison techniques, rather than speci¯c ones for UML diagrams. Conclusion: Fine-grained techniques are still required to support ever-present and complex model comparison tasks during the evolution of design models."
