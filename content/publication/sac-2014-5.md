# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The use of electronic medias for payment has been increasingly adopted, instead of employing money in currency paper or check directly. Considering this electronic funds transfer (EFT) scenario, we developed a model called GetLB which comprises not only a completely new and efficient scheduler but also a cooperative communication infrastructure for handling heterogeneous and dynamic environments. The scientific contribution consists of a scheduling heuristic that combines static data from transactions and dynamic one from processing nodes to overcome the limitations of Round-Robin. Besides the GetLB’s description, this article also presents a prototype evaluation by using both traces and configurations obtained with a real EFT company."
